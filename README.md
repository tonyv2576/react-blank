## About

This template is based of the react template (no typescript).

## Using this template
Open a terminal and run `wails init -n YOUR_PROJECT_NAME -t https://github.com/tonyv2576/react-blank`
You can also use the `-d` flag to create a project in the current directory `-d ./`

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
